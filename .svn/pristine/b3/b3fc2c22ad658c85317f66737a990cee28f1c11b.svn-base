Perhaps, we could say a few words on the fact that we are
trying to simulate a chip connected to the network.
I could add a paragraph on what we really have:

The chip simulator includes a network controller simulator
(from Texas Instruments, not proven...)
and this network controller simulator
is plugged to the real network through an interface,
using the libpcap library, so the simulator can
communicate with the real world. I do have a ping demo...

and we can claim to want to prove networking software...
