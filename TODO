--------------------------------------------------------------------

- create a cma/cmxa for compcert for not having to check its
   dependencies every time with ocamlbuild
 
- check rendering of html doc generated from coq and ocaml files

- check and complete README.simgen

- check that README.simgen and simgen/main -help are coherent

- add README files in subdirectories

- add more comments in the OCaml files of the simgen directory
