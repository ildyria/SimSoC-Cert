\begin{abstract}
The simulation of Systems-on-Chip (SoC) is nowadays a hot topic
because, beyond providing many debugging facilities,
it allows the development of dedicated software before
the hardware is available.
Low-consumption CPUs such as ARM play a central role in SoC.
However, the effectiveness of simulation depends on the faithfulness
of the simulator. 
To this effect, we propose here to prove significant parts of
such a simulator, SimSoC.
Basically, on one hand, we develop a Coq formal model of the ARM 
architecture while on the other hand, we consider a
version of the simulator including components written in Compcert-C.
Then we prove that the simulation of ARM operations, 
according to Compcert-C formal semantics, 
conforms to the expected formal model of ARM.
Size issues are partly dealt with using automatic generation 
of significant parts of the Coq model and of SimSoC from
the official textual definition of ARM.
However, this is still a long-term project. 
We report here the current stage of our efforts
and discuss in particular the use of Compcert-C
in this framework.

  For validating low level embedded software, engineers use simulators
  that take the real binary as input. Like the real hardware, these
  full-system simulators are organized as a set of components. The main
  component is the CPU simulator (ISS), because it is the usual
  bottleneck for the simulation speed, and its development is a long
  and repetitive task. Previous work showed that an ISS can
  be generated from an Architecture Description Language (ADL).  In
  the work reported in this paper, we generate a CPU simulator
  directly from the pseudo-formal descriptions of the reference
  manual. For each instruction, we extract the information describing
  its behavior, its binary encoding, and its assembly syntax. Next,
  after automatically applying many optimizations on the extracted
  information, we generate a SystemC/TLM ISS. We also
  generate tests for the decoder and a formal specification in
  Coq. Experiments show that the generated ISS is as fast and stable
  as our previous hand-written ISS.
