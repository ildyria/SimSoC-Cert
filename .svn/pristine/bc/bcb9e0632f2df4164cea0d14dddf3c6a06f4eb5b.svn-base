>> what's the difference between set_reg and set_reg_or_pc?

In the ARM architecture, the PC is the register number 15.
As a consequence, many instructions can be used as a branch instructions,
even if it is not their first use (e.g., SUB PC, PC, #8 is a valid branch
instruction).
Because the semantics function of each instruction must return with a flag
telling if it was a branch (in addition of the new state), we must check
whether any register modification affects the PC.
In some cases, we know that the destination register cannot be the PC,
because a test Rd!=15 has been executed before. So we can call "set_reg"
directly.
