Example not handled by Coq that we could ?

More explanations in Sec 4
- eg. just a few names to be given, impossible with std inversion,
  possible because we have a full control
- more arguments on productivity
  fully robust against changes in naming algos of Coq
  very robust against changes in Compcert

Using the ad-hoc tactics requires no name to give to variables or
hypotheses.The names are given during defining the general
hc_inversion, according to the meaning of the hypo orwhatever names
you can recognise later.For example, hypo "find_funct ...." is named
"Hfindfunc".When maintaining the scripts, we know which hypo it refers
to.It is done once for all. Unlike using build-in inversion, you don't
need to look at the big inductive definition forthe long list of
variables and permises every time you apply inversion.I don't know if
it answer your question.

And from reading the previous comments. I think the first three
sections are less questioned.Most of the problems are facing the step
to applying it to big project and the experiment result comparison.And
the issue we met in simsoc-cert need to be explained more and
carefully, like naming.We can give some scripts and the generated
proof terms to show the problem more clearly maybe.And I remember, we
did some comparison on timing and compilation results of
derive_inversion, inversion and hc_inversion.We can have them as one
of the good argument.
