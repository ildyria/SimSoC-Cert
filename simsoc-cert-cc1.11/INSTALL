SimSoC-Cert, a toolkit for generating certified processor simulators
See the COPYRIGHTS and LICENSE files

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Prerequisites:

* OCaml 3.12.1 available from http://caml.inria.fr/ .

* Coq 8.4 available from http://coq.inria.fr/ .

* The sources of CompCert 1.11 available from
  http://compcert.inria.fr/ .

* The patch file is available from http://compcert.inria.fr/.
  Do the patch with option "-p 0" before you complie CompCert with Coq 8.4.

* All the prerequisites required for CompCert as described in
  /path/to/compcert/README.

* CompCert configured with target 'ia32-linux' and compiled with Coq
  8.4 as described in /path/to/compcert/README.

* For ARM or SH tests, a binary called 'arm-elf-gcc' or 'sh-elf-gcc'
  needs to be accessible from the path. These binaries can be found
  for example inside the SimSoC project
  (see http://formes.asia/cms/software/simsoc).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Configuration and compilation of CompCert:

See /path/to/compcert/README.

Target to use: ia32-linux.

Warning: 
  The generation of C simulators in arm6/simlight, 
  arm6/simlight2, and sh4/simlight (described below) could fail
  on a 64 bits computer, because the target above is
  set to 'ia32-linux' and CompCert calls 'gcc -m32' which fails.

  In this case, install the package 'libc6-dev-i386'.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Configuration of SimSoC-Cert:

      ./configure /path/to/compcert

This creates in the top directory of SimSoC-Cert a symbolic link to
/path/to/compcert named 'compcert' and creates a file coqrc to add in
your ~/.coqrc file for interactive reading of Coq files in
Emacs/ProofGeneral or CoqIDE.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Compilation of the main SimSoC-Cert tool:

      cd simgen; make

This creates a program 'simgen/main'. Do 'simgen/main -h' to get the
list of options. Read 'README.simgen' for more details.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Generation and compilation of simulators using Simgen:

C simulators:
      cd arm6/simlight; make
      cd arm6/simlight2; make
      cd sh4/simlight; make

Read {arm6,sh4}/simlight/README and arm6/simlight2/README
for more details.

simlight2 is the optimized version of simlight used in SimSoC
(http://formes.asia/cms/software/simsoc).

Run the scripts arm6/test/check-sl and arm6/test/check-sl2 for testing
simlight and simlight2 respectively. This requires an arm-elf-gcc
cross-compiler. See arm6/test/README for more details.

Coq simulators:
      cd arm6/coq; make
      cd sh4/coq; make


OCaml simulators can be extracted
  - from the C simulators:
      cd arm6/simlight; make ocaml
      cd arm6/simlight2; make ocaml
      cd sh4/simlight; make ocaml

  - from the Coq simulators:
      cd arm6/coq; make ocaml
      cd sh4/coq; make ocaml
