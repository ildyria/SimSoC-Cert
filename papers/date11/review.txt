Comments for authors, suggestions for improvements:
The paper presents an attempt to formally prove the correct implementation

of a piece of the SimSoC simulator.

According with the authors, this paper is not a completed work, but just a

first step.



The objective of proving the correctness of a simulator is always a good result,

since it allows users to adopt the simulator in projects oriented in

safety-critical scenarios.



Unfortunately, even if this effort is very huge and useful in practice, it is not

a research or innovation work per se.

It becomes a research work only when the adopted techniques are innovative,

addressing common or hard problems, and they can be reused in similar contexts.



This paper does not address any innovation, but it is just a mere verification.

Morvoer, the verification has been not completed, and the work results ongoing.



The English use is sometimes not suited for a scientific paper.

Some clean up is required.



Thus, reviewer final opinion is that before publication, the work should be

completed,

and the paper should be rewritten, pointing out the innovative ideas and the

techniques

that have general validities.





MINOR ISSUES



- Related Work: usually it is put merged in the introduction, or in a stand

alone section.

 Not in a hybrid way like in this paper.

- Section 2: and words tuples --> and words as tuples

- Section 2: there is no need of a subsection, since there are not other

subsections.

Comments for authors, suggestions for improvements:
 The paper proposes a methodology to develop formal models of microprocessor

architectures. There are some previous works (for example reference [9])

that provides this type of formalizations. The main innovations of the paper

seem to be:

* It formalizes a different ARM architecture.

* A different formal framework is used.

* The reference-pseudo code is automatically translated to the formal

framework (in [9] this process is manual).



Thus, the paper novelty is limited.

Comments for authors, suggestions for improvements:
The authors propose to validate the instruction set simulator.  They

propose to use a theorem prover, Coq.  However, later the in the short

4-page paper, the authors talked about test generation that generates

binary vectors.  It's not clear how the theorem prover and the test

generator are related.  How is the proposed method complete?  There are

many such loop-holes that leaves the paper very vague in what the

authors plan to do.



There were numerous typos and grammatical errors throughout the paper.

Comments for authors, suggestions for improvements:
This paper describes the efforts of the authors to formally prove the

correctness of a n SoC simulator, SimSoC.



This paper might become a good case study, but right now it is not complete.

There are no results. There are also no stated properties which have been

checked, or theorems which have been proven.



Section III.E. is confusing because it introduces test generation, but the

paper is stated to be about formal verification. How are the tests and the

formal methods used together?
