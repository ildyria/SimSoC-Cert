@Comment staticISS-zhu-gajski,
@Comment The paper describes a static compilation retargetable simulator.
@Comment Apparently it does not generate decoder, the paper is not clear about
@Comment this.  The input instructions are first translated into a virtual
@Comment machine instructions, with an infinite number of registers. Then a
@Comment back end translates the virtual instructions into host code, and there
@Comment is a dedicated register allocator.  The result is a compiled program
@Comment running on the host.  It does not support target endianness different
@Comment from the host.  Because it is static compile it is fast, the best is
@Comment 200 Mips on a 2004 PC.  But it looks like from the paper example that
@Comment they do not simulate the condition code unless they have a compare
@Comment instruction...  This seems to be confirmed by the DynamoSim paper
@Comment where they say in the introduction that ``Compared to the proposed
@Comment method, these simulators are not flexible, and do not simulate target
@Comment machine state such as conditional codes, which can significantly slow
@Comment down simulation''

@Comment Leupers99 In the JACOB system, a processor is described with the MIMOLA
@Comment language, a low level description. From the MIMOLA input, a C program
@Comment is generated that simulates the processor. Basic operations have been
@Comment manually coded however. The MIMOLA compiler generates C macros using
@Comment the basic functions. Then the whole C program is compiled. So it is
@Comment not entirely generated, there are basic operations manually coded. The
@Comment generated code is doing interpretive simulation, and since the input
@Comment is low level, the simulation speed is in hundreds of Kips, (< 1 Mips)

@Comment naul-braun-jit-iccs
@Comment The paper describes a kind of dynamic compilation simulator generated
@Comment from the LISA description language. The LISA language is sort of a
@Comment virtual machine describing low level processor operations. For example
@Comment the ADD instruction is described using about 10 lines of LISA.
@Comment Apparently, the decoder is generated.
@Comment The C code for the basic LISA operations is manually coded first.
@Comment hence, the whole code is not generated. There is manually produced C code.
@Comment The simulator works very much like SimSoC.
@Comment On the first execution of an instruction, the sequence of
@Comment basic LISA operations is generated in the cache.
@Comment The speed is not so good, given that they have low level of detail
@Comment and they can simulate a pipe line.
@Comment And the speed they indicate of about 8 Mips is for ARM V4 with no MMU.
@Comment An advantage over SimSoC is that they have a fixed size cache and a
@Comment replacement strategy so the memory can be limited arbitrarily.

@Comment The paper describes generation of simulators for processors described
@Comment in the EXPRESSION-ADL language.  It generates a decoder and a compiler
@Comment for the target instructions.  The decoder is complex, but finally it
@Comment amounts to something similar to SimSoC, a data structure with
@Comment constants, register values and pointers to functions.  An interesting
@Comment idea may be for partial evaluation is that the ADL compiler generates
@Comment C++ templates. The decoder then generates instantiations of these
@Comment templates with specific values.  Therefore the C++ compiler
@Comment instantiates and optimizes the templates.  They claim that their
@Comment language is much better than the above LISA. They say it takes more
@Comment than 1700 lines of LISA to describe the ARM DPI instructions whereas
@Comment it takes only 50 in their ADL.  Apparently some functional ideas...
@Comment They report a maximum speed of 15 Mips for ARM V4, they do not say
@Comment which version.  They say that given a new processor spec, it takes 1
@Comment man month to generate the simulator.

@Comment Engel-2000
@Comment This is for static compilating simulation. The processor is described
@Comment using a lanuage that has no name (they call it a PD-file -- processor
@Comment description) but the language is really C macros... They indeed
@Comment generate C in the end, this C code is executing the primary
@Comment operations.  It is not clear from the paper whether the primary
@Comment operations are manually coded or generated.  This simulator does not
@Comment take the real binary as input, but a kind of virtual machine. They
@Comment generate a decoder/translator that translates the target binary into a
@Comment byte code file, then they take this byte code as input of the compiler
@Comment that generates a C program. Then they call the C compiler and they
@Comment have an executable simulating each step of the target processor for
@Comment the target program. This is cycle accurate simulation.
@Comment The speed is less than 1 Mips (< 500 kips) on a Sun workstation from 1998.

                  it possible to run the exact binary embedded
                  software including the operating system on a totally
                  simulated hardware platform. {W}hereas most
                  simulation environments do not support full system
                  simulation, or do not use any hardware modeling
                  techniques, or have combined different types of
                  technology, {S}im{S}o{C} is developing a full system
                  simulation architecture with an integrated approach
                  relying only upon {S}ystem{C} hardware modeling and
                  transaction level modeling abstractions ({TLM}) for

@article{Chandy1979,
    abstract = {The problem of system simulation is typically solved
                  in a sequential manner due to the wide and intensive
                  sharing of variables by all parts of the system. We
                  propose a distributed solution where processes
                  communicate only through messages with their
                  neighbors; there are no shared variables and there
                  is no central process for message routing or process
                  scheduling. Deadlock is avoided in this system
                  despite the absence of global control. Each process
                  in the solution requires only a limited amount of
                  memory. The correctness of a distributed system is
                  proven by proving the correctness of each of its
                  component processes and then using inductive
                  arguments. The proposed solution has been
                  empirically found to be efficient in preliminary
                  studies. The paper presents formal, detailed proofs
                  of correctness.},
