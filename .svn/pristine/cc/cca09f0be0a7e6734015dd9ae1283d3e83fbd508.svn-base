This directory contains a small tool called "bin2elf", written in
C++. This tool takes as input a binary file containing a list of ARM
instructions in binary format, and outputs an ELF file which ".text"
section contains the corresponding instructions.

Usage:

1. generate a binary file:
simgen -ipc arm6inst.arm -idec arm6dec.dat -isyntax arm6syntax.dat -s 0 -obin-test > test.bin

2. convert to ELF:
bin2elf test.bin test.elf

3. print the file in human readable format:
arm-elf-objdump -d test.elf

Some compatibility issues have been noticed between the generated ELF
file and arm-elf-objdump version 2.19. Tell the developpers if you
encounter any problem with arm-elf-objdump version 2.20.
