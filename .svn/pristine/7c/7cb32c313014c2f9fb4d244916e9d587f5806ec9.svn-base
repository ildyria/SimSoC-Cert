Material to be added here, as support to
"Handcrafted Inversions Made Operational on Operational Semantics", 
by JF Monin and SHI Xiaomu, submitted.

This directory contains (or will soon contain):

1) Simple scripts for illustrating our handcrafted inversion
  - scripts for the examples given in the paper
    (file paperscript.v)
  - additional scripts, for fun (any other file XXX.v)

2) Material related to SimSoC-cert, illustrating handcrafted inversion
   in a much more complicated framework, using the operational semantics
   of C defined in Compcert

  - a file containing an excerpt of the C code from the SimSoC-cert project
    (pieces_of_simlight_code.c)

  - 2 tar gzipped directories for the relevant part of SimSoC-cert.

    One is to be used with compcert 1.9 and Coq 8.3pl2 or 8.3pl4
    (8.3plX, for any X>=2 probably works),
    providing time and size comparisons with tactics of inversion available 
    in Coq : inversion, derive inversion, implementation of McBride's
    BasicElim.

    The other is to be used with compcert 1.11 and Coq 8.4,
    providing time comparisons only with with BasicElim:
    the point is to show that maintenance is much easier with
    our inversion, and we actually do not want to maintain scripts with
    standard inversion.
    Note that the Coq implementation of BasicElim includes a naming scheme
    which happens to be rather convenient in this example: the name of the
    inverted hypothesis is reused in such a way that we can conveniently
    repeat the process using LTac; therefore, maintaining the script is
    easier than with standard inversion. However a dozen of uncontrollable 
    names appear on this example, so that maintenance is still an issue
    with BasicElim.
    In summary we don't use BasicElim in SimSoC-cert, because 
    - it finally does not provide enough control on names
    - it is slower
    - And moreover, it uses unnecessary axioms.
