SimSoC-Cert, a toolkit for generating certified processor simulators
See the COPYRIGHTS and LICENSE files
--------------------------------------------------------------------

SimSoC-Cert is available on http://formes.asia/cms/software/simsoc-cert .

The aim of SimSoC-Cert is to provide tools for:

- extracting useful information (assembly syntax, instruction binary
  encoding, instruction semantics/pseudo-code) from the PDF
  documentation of various processors (ARMv6, SH4),

- generating from this extracted information instructions set
  simulators in various programming languages (Coq, C),

- automatically check in the Coq proof assistant (http://coq.inria.fr)
  that the generated C code is equivalent to the generated Coq code by
  using the semantics of C formalized in the Coq library of the
  CompCert project (http://compcert.inria.fr).
